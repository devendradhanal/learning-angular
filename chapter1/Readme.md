Steps to get started with AngularJS:

  1. Reference the AngularJS script in an HTML page
  2. Add an ng-app directive
  3. Bind data using directives


Experiment 1 

Two text boxes one with ng-model="name" 
and other with value="{{name}}" 

After page reload the data binding works fine but when 
I delete the content of second text box after that 
databinding doesnt reflect.
